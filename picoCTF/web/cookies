# 🍪 picoCTF Writeup — Cookies Challenge

**Category:** Web Exploitation  
**Difficulty:** Easy  

---

## 🧩 Description
The challenge required identifying the “best cookie” by analyzing how the web application handled HTTP cookies.

---

## 🔎 Reconnaissance
Viewing page source revealed hints suggesting category-based responses.  
Traffic inspection showed a cookie named:

name=<value>

The server response changed depending on this value.

---

## 🕵️ Enumeration
Using Burp Suite, the cookie value was modified manually.

Different integer values produced different responses, indicating the server trusted user-controlled cookie input.

---

## ⚔️ Exploitation
Sequential testing revealed that:

name=18

returned privileged content when accessing `/check`.

---

## 🚩 Flag

picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_a4dadb49}

---

## 🧠 Vulnerability
**Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)** via cookie manipulation.

The application failed to validate authorization server-side.

---

## 🛠 Tools
- Browser
- Burp Suite
- curl

---

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Never trust client-side data.
- Predictable identifiers enable enumeration attacks.
